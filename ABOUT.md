Our goal for the apps we're developing is to recreate the essence of Scrivener’s writing experience — without its complexity, particularly around compiling — while also drawing inspiration from Ulysses, and combining the best elements that both apps offer alongside the unique strengths Crowdly already brings.
We still have a considerable journey ahead, but the direction is clear and we can already clearly see the light at the end of the tunnel. 😊
With any luck, we’ll successfully arrive at the place we’re aiming for.
Let’s see how beautifully we can bring all of this together.

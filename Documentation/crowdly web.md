I'm not really happy with the current functionality for story creation and collaboration and versioning of it, etc

I'm glad it at least partially works and I can show it to other people, however so really happy am I not.

Crowdly software has to be clever enough to differentiate between 

title
chapter 

and recognise a new paragraph, like any being who can read would (not like it is currently relized in the code)

I wonder, what logic can we use for making paragraphs into blocks automatically by software?

Versioning has to happen always and fully automatically, without even the user being aware of it and should (s)he need the information (s)he would easily find it 

What current stories are missing is:

on the Story level:

Delete (already there)
Rename (also already there)
Clone story (create a new story ID for the story and assign it to the user who clones it - this should be very easy to implement, I assume)
Private | Public 
Publish | Unpublish (defining visibility on platform with the states: published | unpublished)
Comment (on the whole story)
Like (the whole story)

On Chapter level:

Rename
Clone 
Delete
Comment
Like
Publish | Unpublish

On Paragraph level:

Right click  or long tap on touchscreen devices calls menu with:

Branch
Delete (paragraph block - I know it also could be done by marking the text and pressing delete button, however it is nice to have both options)
Comment
Like

On Branches level (Branches tab)

1. Compare (up to four branches at ones - in up to 4 edittable pane editors in all possible variants:

1. two horizontal ones 
2. two vertical ones
3,4. two horizontal ones and one or two vertical (either on the left or on the right) 
5, 6. two vertical ones and two horizontal ones (either at the top or at the bottom)
7. one horizontal at the top, two vertical below, and one horizontal at the bottom
8. three horizontal
9. three vertical 
10. four horizontal
11. four vertical ones
12. two square ones at the top and two square ones at the bottom (four squares in total)

2. Delete
3. Accept
4. Reject

(
and there 3 states for that: 
1. merged into the text
2. rejected (moved into rejected)
3. undecided (just hangs there
)

we need better UI / UX for them 

Database of the words typed by the user and all users
Word suggestions based on the words user already typed (accepting them by either presing enter (keyboard typing) or by clicking the suggestion (touchscreen typing))

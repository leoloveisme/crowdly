I'd like to develop a local editor: (developed with Python or Python framework)

1. text / Markdown / HTML
2. WYSIWYG preview for 1 where one also can edit the text as well (WYSIWYG editor) 

in the same window. (similar to how it is done in Obsidian)

text / WYSIWYG preview and WYSIWYG editor

what file .ending should it save into? .md, .html or some other file format?

distraction free mode (on / off)

All text is automatically saved.

The files are saved locally. 

It will be able to create directories and sub-directories. 

regular (minimal) stand alone installation (with a possibility to fine tune the client in the settings)

burger button / right click / long touch anf hold (touch screen devices) - calls contextual menu with various functions such as copy, cut, insert, delete, export, etc 

If user decides to synchronise the local data with a third-party storage online, it should be possible to connect and configure in the settings

The client has to be modular and ability to add extentions at a later time should be possible as well. 

Multilingual.

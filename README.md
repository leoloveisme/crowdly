# crowdly

Crowd created stories: text, audio and video (3D VR and / or AR) 

Think Youtube, Netflix, Wattpad, Audible in one platform with versioning and branching (of the crowd[ly]-created) stories and Discord similar functionality to discuss the stories with the ability to star and save selected messages.

The platform envisioned to be easy to use for not information technologies advanced users and should provide a deeper customisation and configuration for technically advanced users.

# Welcome to Crowdly

Crowd created entertainment entertainemnt platform - where YOUR eintertainment (l)i(ve)s

Crowdly – Multi creator / crowd created entertainment entertainment platform – think Audible + Netflix + Github + Wattpad (text, pictures, audio and / or video [3D VR / AR and / or MR]) and all this is AI assisted. 

Currently the project is in the development and in it's very baby shoes. The idea behind the project is quite mature, however the realisation still isn't, because there is quite a lot to be developed, and there're unfortunately also financial constraints atm of (me) writing this. // UPDATE: The project has reached it's MVP stage.

The project is quite complex and it will have an online platform, local clients (software) and apps for major OSes. // Currently we have MVP desktop client for Linux. 

Crowd created branching stories: text, pictures (cartoons), audio and video (3D VR, AR and / or MR - mixed reality) 

Think Youtube, Netflix, Wattpad, Audible in one platform with versioning and branching (of the crowd[ly]-created) stories and Discord similar functionality to discuss the stories with the ability to star and save selected messages.

The platform envisioned to be easy to use for not information technologies advanced users and should provide a deeper customisation and configuration for technically advanced users. 

Re-write any favorite story to your liking: change characters, places, beginnings and endings....
